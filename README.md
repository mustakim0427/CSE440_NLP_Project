We begin by loading and exploring your assigned dataset. The dataset is already split into training and testing sets in an 80-20 ratio, provided as separate CSV files. Use the training set for model training and validation, and the testing set strictly for final evaluation. Perform basic exploratory data analysis (EDA) and necessary text preprocessing. 
Designed and implemented four types of models: a simple Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), a Long Short-Term Memory network (LSTM), a Gated Recurrent Unit network (GRU), and a Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM). To build our models, we may used deep learning framework, such as Keras.
Tune the hyperparameters of each model by experimenting with learning rates, batch sizes, number of epochs, and other settings. Use validation performance to guide our decisions during tuning. Evaluated the performance of each model using relevant metrics. You must calculate and report accuracy, F1-score (macro and/or weighted), the confusion matrix, and the classification report. Included both visual and tabular representations to compare the models.
